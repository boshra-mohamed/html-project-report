Artificial intelligence
<h3>
In simpler terms, the term artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems or devices that mimic human intelligence to perform tasks that can improve themselves based on the information they collect. Artificial intelligence manifests itself in a number of forms. Some of these examples are:
Conversation robots use artificial intelligence to understand customer problems faster and provide more efficient answers
AI-based operators use it to analyze critical information from a wide range of text data to improve scheduling
Recommendation engines can make automated recommendations for TV shows based on users â€™viewing habits.Artificial intelligence is more about the ability to think super and analyze data than to be attached to a particular shape or function. Although artificial intelligence provides images of human-like high-performance robots that dominate the world, it is not intended to replace humans. It aims to greatly enhance human capabilities and contributions. Which makes it a valuable asset from the business.
Artificial intelligence has become a comprehensive term for applications that perform complex tasks that in the past required human inputs such as communicating with customers over the Internet or playing chess. The term is often used interchangeably with its sub-fields, which include machine learning and deep learning. However, there are differences. For example, machine learning focuses on creating systems that learn or improve their performance based on the data they consume. It is important to note that although all avenues of machine learning are only artificial intelligence, not all artificial intelligence is machine learning.
To get the full value of artificial intelligence, many companies are making major investments in data science teams. Data science, which is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods and other methods to extract value from data, combines skills derived from fields such as statistics and computer science with the scientific knowledge to analyze data collected from multiple sources

How AI can help organizations
<h3>
The main principle of artificial intelligence is to simulate and transcend the way humans absorb and interact with the world around us. This quickly became the cornerstone of innovation. After AI becomes equipped with many forms of machine learning that recognize patterns of data in order to make predictions, AI can add value to your business by:
To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the flood of available data
Rely on forecasts to automate highly complex tasks as well as usual tasks
<h2>
Artificial intelligence in the sky of institutions
<h3>
Artificial intelligence technology improves enterprise performance and productivity by automating processes or tasks that previously required manpower. And AI can understand data on a scale that no human being can achieve. This ability can bring significant business benefits. For example, Netflix uses machine learning to provide a level of customization which has helped the company grow its customer base by more than 25 percent in 2017.
Most companies have made data science a priority for them and are still investing heavily in them. According to a survey by Gartner of more than 3,000 CEOs, in which participants rated professional analytics and information as the best technology featured for their organization. The chief executives surveyed believe that these technologies are the most strategic for their companies, and therefore, they attract the most new investments.
Artificial intelligence provides value for most jobs, businesses, and fields. It includes general applications and applications for specific fields, such as:
Use of transaction and demographic data to forecast the extent to which particular customers spend over their relationship with the company (or the customer's permanent value)
Optimizing pricing based on customer behavior and preferences
Use the image recognition feature to analyze x-ray images of cancer signs
