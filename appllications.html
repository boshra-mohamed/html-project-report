Artificial intelligence makes mobile applications much smarter
<h3>
AI allows computers to perform many tasks that humans perform, so that it can correct our mistakes. Artificial intelligence includes many things such as machine learning and knowledge management, as it is used on the level of mobile applications to develop chatbots, context-aware sensors, and all kinds of user interfaces.
It can be said that artificial intelligence is rapidly contributing to the creation of a market for interactive applications.
A study by Forrester Research indicates that annual investment in artificial intelligence worldwide will increase by 300% in 2017. Gartner predicts that AI applications will rank among the top 10 strategic directions in the technology market In 2017, the mobile application market will see an increase in the number of AI applications in 2018, given that more than 200 businesses in the world are involved in developing these tools.

The effect of artificial intelligence on application development
<h3>
Mobile applications have always included a type of artificial intelligence in their backgrounds since the beginnings of developing this type of application, but today AI is at the forefront.
A lot of people have become aware of the impact of artificial intelligence since Apple launched Siri. The latter - although it was developed using static-based and directive-based algorithms - opened the doors to applications that possess properties similar to those of humans.
To show how the artificial intelligence has evolved, a traditional thermostat can be compared to a Nest: a conventional thermostat that adjusts the heater or air conditioner to a preset temperature according to a timer, and "Nest" is a smart device that has dynamic features that enable it to record user preferences With the passage of time and adjust his system accordingly.
Currently, major smart mobile application companies, such as Google, IBM, Sony, Apple and Samsung, are focusing on projects in the areas of artificial intelligence and voice assistant.
Cloud computing and big data computing played a major role in putting AI in the foreground.
IBM Watson, which was a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence, is now in the process of creating a variety of mobile applications for companies. Although the algorithms have not changed for the most part, artificial intelligence is becoming more prominent than before.
And Google acquired DeepMind for $ 600 million to focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning.
The start-up company Faraday Future, which unveiled its super self-driving car at the CES 2017, is changing the face of technology with its electric car, which can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour (97 kilometers per hour) in just 2.3 seconds. .
There are also many companies that use artificial intelligence to develop iPhone and Android applications to enrich the user experience.
AI-powered smart apps also make daily tasks easier. Within this framework, Starbucks, the global coffee beverage company, recently announced the launch of an artificial intelligence application called "My Starbucks Barista" to facilitate customer requests.
Likewise, the California-based TacoBell fast food chain recently launched an enhanced application of artificial intelligence. This application not only allows you to order meals, but also provides recommendations and answers your questions as well.
<h2>
Among the applications that use artificial intelligence to some extent:
<h3>
Facebook: uses artificial intelligence for the face recognition feature to know the people in the photos, exactly as anyone would do.
Flipkart: The online shopping Flipkart app uses artificial intelligence to search for goods using related images.
Google Image Search: Google's search engine uses artificial intelligence to find relevant images.
Siri: The Siri app from Apple is an audio assistant that uses artificial intelligence with fixed algorithms.
Google Allo: a smart application that helps its users exchange messages and files, and can also specify the numbers that the user communicates with more.
Amazon Alexa: a smart personal assistant, who can interact with its users by voice, organize task lists, and informs them of the latest news and weather conditions.

    <td>It gives drivers greater mobility and independence, and some people may even symbolize social status. These reasons, and the associated increase in the availability of affordable cars, have led to a rapid growth in car ownership - in 2010, the number of cars in the world reached 1,015 billion cars, but by 2035 the number of cars on the roads is expected to reach 1 7 billion cars.
 This growth will negatively affect the time spent on the trip, as employees in the United States of America spend an average of 38 hours a year stuck in the traffic jam between work and home. This is surprising, given that the car is used on average for less than 10 percent of the time. These additional numbers of cars will also exacerbate existing safety statistics: every year there are 1.24 million road accidents deaths in the world, the most important of which is drunk driving and straying while driving, for example by writing text messages while driving. Car technology changes have to be made to meet growing demand and improve road safety while safeguarding the freedoms associated with owning cars.

    <td> Driverless cars represent a shift in the way we understand transportation, both technologically and socially. However, achieving an independent future depends on a number of key elements such as culture, political will, raising public awareness, and user acceptance.
Over a period of six months, the architecture of the hardware and software used in driverless Buggy golf carts has been reproduced in a SCOT, an electric vehicle converted into a driverless car for use on public roads. This car provides the ability to move on demand (MoD), which is a simple concept through which smart electric cars can move independently from human interference, and stop to take and drop passengers. This is a flexible transportation system that balances demand and real-time planning.
The vehicle is equipped with LIDAR sensors ready for detection. The sensors and computers on board are valued at US $ 30,000, so this technology is not only low-cost, but also provides a full field of vision of 360 degrees - compared to a field of view of 100 degrees in humans - to give information about the bodies surrounding the car. The surrounding environment maps with LIDAR sensor data, while on-board computers use algorithms developed by the SMART team to understand the surrounding 3D environment using two-dimensional LIDAR scanners.

    <td>Google Assistant is a virtual personal assistant that has been developed in Google format now as well as the OK Google voice command service, except that the distinction in Google Assistant is that it works through a personal chat system, so that you can direct the questions and commands you want inside the chat box by writing them or through the microphone and Google Assistant will answer you and answer your questions also in the same manner as chat programs with the slight difference that you are chatting with an AI machine and not with a real friend.
